      <blockquote align="center">Stitch, formerly known as Experiment 626, was created
                  as a machine of destruction. After being sentenced to a lifetime in
                  extraterrestrial prison, Stitch escapes prison and heads to Planet
                  Earth. Stich poses as a dog, gets adopted by a girl named Lilo, and
                  finds his new family. Stitch now lives with Lilo in Hawaii.
